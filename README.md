## Future Improvements
I will add some content of Php, Phyton, mongo db into this project.

I will have to optimise the website to stand out among its competitors.

 
## The Technologies I have used
This includes HTML W3Schools, for adhering to the correct HTML syntax
CSS W3Schools for adhering to the correct CSS syntax
downloads
I used this JS programming for creating some logic to the project work

 
## Validators
I used
[HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and
[CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate the web document. 
Minor errors appeared from its content and I made some corrections.

 
## Testing
The logo is displayed in bold colours to the top right of the page.

I am happy to browse through a website that is very easy to navigate through.

As a Car enthusiast, I am glad to visit cars online to learn about trending cars. 

Being a one-page website it is visible and easy to access at any given point in time.
 
At the footer, various Links to the social media network is displayed. 

 
## Home Page
This is the Index page, more so, the landing page once entered it takes the user to all the necessary details of the website.

 
## Header Section
It contains the names of the logo and the different sections of the links and its content.


## Outcome
The website is simple and working well,
At the moment I am taking care of my younger one during the day, While I work during the night and try to study in between.
I am still trying to learn all I could do to become a great Software Engineer.

## Bugs
I have not noticed any bug at the moment.

I am still carrying out some finding to see if there is any potential bug.

## Deployment
Deploying the GitHub Pages from my Desktop
Log into GitHub.
I will have to create a repository which is
[3RD PROJECT](Sampatbraide/third-milestone-project.github.io/)
after doing that I will upload my project to the repository
this will take a couple of minutes.

 
Moreso I can also use
[MAKE A README](https://https://www.makeareadme.com/)
Type the document format it and transfer it to [GITHUB](http://github.com/)
As I could examine it a re-test by ensuring that everything is working as expected.
